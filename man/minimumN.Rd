\title{Calculate minimum sample size for 1-sample or 2-sample t-tests}
\usage{
minimumN(x1, x2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{First sample data as numeric vector for one-sample or two-sample t-tests.}

\item{x2}{Second sample data as numeric vector for two-sample t-tests.}
}
\value{
Integer. Minimum sample size required PER GROUP to achieve 80\% power at alpha = 0.05
for the specified t-test.
}
\description{
\code{minimumN} is a wrapper around \code{pwr::pwr.t.test} that computes the minimum sample size
needed for conducting one-sample or two-sample t-tests with pre-specified power and significance
levels.
}
\details{
This function performs a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size required
for conducting a t-test under specified conditions:
\itemize{
\item 1-sample t-test: Tests the null hypothesis that the mean of \code{x1} is 0.
\item 2-sample t-test: Tests the null hypothesis that the means of \code{x1} and \code{x2} are equal.
}

The function uses Cohen's d effect size to estimate the required sample size based on the
desired statistical power (80\%) and significance level (alpha = 0.05).

\examples{
# Calculate minimum sample size for one-sample t-test
minimumN(c(1, 2, 3))

# Calculate minimum sample size for two-sample t-test
minimumN(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6))
